# Complete Themes

Complete themes are objects that satisfy typescript type `CompleteThemeSpec` from `@chsk/core`.

## `darkTheme`

`darkTheme` defines a theme suitable for use with dark backgrounds.
Apart from reversing dark and light colors, `darkTheme` is otherwise very similar to the default theme.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="dark">
        <ThemeController
            chart={ThemeScatterChart}
            chartId={'darkTheme'}
            themes={{ darkTheme, defaultTheme }}
            baseTheme={true}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

Note that if a chart specifies colors using inline styles, those styles will not be affected by the theme.
In the chart above, for example, the regression line specifies a dark-gray color with a `stroke` setting passed to a `style` prop,
and that color is not adjusted via the theme, becoming almost imperceptible on a dark background.
This detail reveals that toggling themes may not automatically give perfect outcomes,
and some charts may require manual adjustment.

## `emptyTheme`

`emptyTheme` is an object that satisfies the `CompleteThemeSpec` interface but does not hold any data.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="empty">
        <ThemeController
            chart={ThemeScatterChart}
            chartId={'emptyTheme'}
            themes={{ emptyTheme, defaultTheme }}
            baseTheme={true}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

As evidenced in the example above, using `emptyTheme` on its own is likely to produce very poor outcomes.
However, `emptyTheme` is valuable because it is a bare-bones structure that can be provided to prop `baseTheme`
in the `Chart` component, upon which it is then possible to build a new theme from scratch.

To understand why a bare-bones theme is valuable, recall that the `Chart` component uses the chart theme to
generate the content of the `<style>` tag in an svg graphic.
The default theme provides styles for several commonly-used elements such as text in titles, legends, and tooltips.
Altogether, those definitions add around 3kb to the size of each chart.
If a particular chart type does not require many of those styles, it may be worthwhile to exclude them.
Unfortunately, removing styles from the default theme is not straightforward
(it has to do with how nested objects are merged in lodash/javascript, and with typescript types).
Thus, to achieve a smaller footprint for the `<style>` tag, it is necessary to start from a bare theme and then
add the elements required for a given application.
