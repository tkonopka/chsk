# HeatMap

<Meta title="Addons/Matrix/HeatMaps/HeatMap" />

export const Template = args => <HeatMap {...args} />

`HeatMap` sets up a view for a heat map.

<ArgsTable of={HeatMap} />

`HeatMap` is an organizational component and it does not draw any visual elements. However, it manages datasets that can be visualized with other components, for example `HeatMapCells`.

The examples in this page showcase `HeatMap` by automatically using `HeatMapCells` as a child component. Note that to create a complete chart, additional components would normally be employed, for example adding axes and labels.

## Data

Data should be prepared as an array of objects. All objects should contain a string identifier `'id'`. Other keys can be used to encode information that will be turned into colors in the heat map.

The pseudocode below shows one data item with an identifier and three numeric values.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
[
  {
    "id": "alpha",
    "x": 55,
    "y": 35,
    "z": 10
  },
  ...
]
`}
/>

An analogous format is also used to encode heat map cell size.

## Color scales

`HeatMap` accepts both continuous and categorical color scales. The first example below is based on a matrix with numeric values and converts these numbers into many shades. The second example is based on a matrix of strings and displays a fixed number of colors.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="default"
        args={{
            ...commonProps,
            children: <HeatMapCells />,
        }}
        component={HeatMap}
        decorators={[ChartDecoratorEqualPadding]}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
    <Story
        name="categorical"
        args={{
            ...commonCategoricalProps,
            children: <HeatMapCells />,
        }}
        component={HeatMap}
        decorators={[ChartDecoratorEqualPadding]}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

Again, the two maps above are based on different data - there is no mapping between the colors of two examples.

## Size scales

The heat map supports cells of non-constant sizes. Use prop `dataSize` to specify the cell sizes, and prop `scaleSize` to specify the required scaling. The format for `dataSize` is the same as for `data`, which ensures that the same ids and keys are used to match colors and sizes.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="size"
        args={{
            ...commonProps,
            dataSize: commonProps.data,
            children: <HeatMapCells />,
        }}
        component={HeatMap}
        decorators={[ChartDecoratorEqualPadding]}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

In the example above, the same data object is presented to both `data` and `dataSize`, so color intensity and cell size are proportional.

## Padding

By default, the rows and columns in the heatmap are placed directly adjacent to each other. The space between rows and columns can be adjusted through props `scaleX` and `scaleY`.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="padding"
        args={{
            ...commonProps,
            scaleX: { variant: 'band', padding: 0.15 },
            scaleY: { variant: 'band', padding: 0.15 },
            children: <HeatMapCells />,
        }}
        component={HeatMap}
        decorators={[ChartDecoratorEqualPadding]}
    >
        {Template.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
