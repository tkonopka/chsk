# `useDisabledKeys`

The `useDisabledKeys` hook retrieves information about 'keys' that have been disabled, for example via the legend.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
import { useDisabledKeys } from '@chsk/core'

// in a JSX component:
const { disabledKeys, firstRender } = useChartData()
`} />

-   `disabledKeys` will be a set of string containing those 'keys' that have been marked as disabled.

-   `firstRender` will be a boolean value. The value is a guess that indicates whether or not the set of disabled keys has been manipulated before or not.

It is also possible to invoke the hook with an argument, specifying keys of interest.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
// in a JSX component (using an array of strings)
const { disabledKeys, firstRender, disabled } = useChartData(keysOfInterest)
`}
/>

-   `disabled` will be an array of boolean values matching the entries in `keysOfInterest`. The booleans will indicate whether the keys of interest have been disabled. This information can be easily computed from the set `disabledKeys`, but the array is provided for convenience.

-   (the other outputs are equivalent to above)
