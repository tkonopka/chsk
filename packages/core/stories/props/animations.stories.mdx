# Animations

Animations are implemented using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/).

Their configuration can be set via themes, using key 'Motion'.
The example below specifies a spring-based animation (values correspond to the default theme).

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
const customTheme = {
  Motion: {
     mass: 0.5,
     stiffness: 250,
     damping: 25,
  }
}`}
/>

Settings that can be included in the 'Motion' dictionary are: `duration`, `bounce`, `mass`, `stiffness`, and `damping`.
For detailed description of their role in animations, see the [motion-framer documentation](https://www.framer.com/docs/transition/).
In particular, note that some properties may over-ride others. Some rules of thumb are:

-   Larger stiffness increases responsiveness, i.e. makes animations seem to begin faster.
-   Larger damping reduces oscillations.

To apply custom animation settings, use prop `theme` in the `Chart` component.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
<Chart {...props} theme={customTheme}>
  ...
</Chart>`}
/>

All settings apply equally to all chart content.
