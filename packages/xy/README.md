# `@chsk/xy`

`@chsk/xy` is part of a data visualization framework based on `@chsk/core`.
It provides components for charts in which both the horizontal and vertical
axes display continuous values.

## Features

-   **Histograms** summarize numeric distributions using binned or smooth curves
-   **Scatter charts** display data points as symbols on a 2D plane
-   **Line charts**, similarly to scatter charts, display data on a 2D plane, but use curves and/or areas to show connections between data points
