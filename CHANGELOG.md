    for contexts holding processed data for views
-   [polar] changed types for labels to allow React components
-   [set] changed types for labels to allow React components

    after a refresh, causing charts to redraw momentarily with new data but
    out-of-date scales
-   [core] fixed missing motion in `Polygon`
-   [band] restricted types for `BarsLabels` prop `format`; the value axis
    requires numeric values

    `TypographyProps`)
-   [core] simplified implementation of `Typography`, `Label`, and `Counter`
    components to remove unnecessary `g` elements

-   [xy] components `Density`, `DensityCells`, `DensityCrosshair`,
    `DensityCell`, and `DensitySimpleCell` for creating density maps
-   [matrix] components `HeatMapCircle` and `HeatMapRectangle` to support
    heatmaps that animate color transitions; the default settings still
    create maps without animations to prioritize performance
-   [xy] support for row-based and column-based datasets for `Scatter` views
-   [core] function `cloneProps` to create shallow/deep copies of prop objects
-   [core] wrapper `PersistentTooltipDataComponent` to create tooltips that

    `HeatMapCircle` to `HeatMapSimpleRectangle` and `HeatMapSimpleCircle` to
    convey they have minimal features (no animations); renamed cell
    components `HeatMapColorRectangle` and `HeatMapColorCircle` to
    `HeatMapRectangle` and `HeatMapCircle` for brevity
-   [all] replaced `merge` from lodash with spread operator (when possible)
    and with custom `mergeProps` and `fillProps` implementations

    free of side effects
-   [core] replaced a few functions from lodash by own implementations
    (`isNull`, `isUndefined`, `sortedIndex`)

### Changed

-   [band] changed components with prefix `Distribution` (back) to using
    prefix `Quantile`. This is more accurate/specific as to what the
    components represent and avoids confusion with `Violin` components that
    also describe distributions but use slightly different data types
-   [band] fixed bug in calculation of domains in strip and distribution
    charts, which forced inclusion of '1' in domain in cases with missing data

-   [annotation] changed role and class strings in `GridStripes` to improve
    consistency with other components
-   [core] fixed expanding chart size when `stretch=true`
-   [xy] removed `signals.tsx` from exports because functions are only used
    internally in xy package
-   [core] fixed internal keys in `GridLines` to avoid lines switching
    position during panning
-   [xy] discontinued support for single-value position in `ScatterLabel` in
    favor of using a new prop `variant`
-   [annotation] changed `cleanSvg` into `transformSvg` to give a more neutral
    note to the function; changed typings and prop names to similarly replace
    'clean' into 'transform'
-   [annotation] renamed prop `offset` with `distance` in `BoxedTitle` for
    consistency with convention used by axes whereby offset is always an array
    and distance is orthogonal distance
-   [xy] expanded API for `ScatterLabel` to use `LabelProps` and a
    custom component to draw; `ScatterLabel` can now use, e.g. `BoxedLabel`
-   [xy] replaced prop `ids` with `id` in `ScatterLabel` because the component
    is meant to create a single label for a single data series

    `TooltipDataComponent` leading to some missed and some redundant function
    calls
-   [documentation] miscellaneous edits, including fixes to styling

    `Slices`
-   [core] renamed prop in `AxisLabel` from `anchor` to `align` for more
    consistency with props in typography components

    consistency (using nouns more than verbs); moved the `offset` prop into
    `ContainerProps`

    boxed labels
-   [core] changed `Counter` animations to spring for consistency with other
    components
-   [core] renamed `useView` hook to `useContainer`
-   [all] changed view props so that `position`, `positionUnits`, `size`,
    `sizeUnits`, `padding`, and `anchor` are now nested in a single
    `container` prop. This simplifies internal code and docs for add-on views.

    layered charts
-   [band] changed interpretation of prop `variant` in `Strip`; point
    arrangements now set via new prop `jitter`
-   [all] changed rollup config to reduce bundle sizes by excluding
    framer-motion
-   [core] changed a typing on cart context props to simplify tests
-   [core] changed prop `role` in `MilestoneMotion` to `setRole` for
    consistency with other components, and to enable setting a role by default
-   [core] changed fill opacity for path components in `defaultTheme`
-   [annotation] fixed bug with `BlockArrow` rotation
-   [core] simplified typescript type for tick label format in `AxisTicks`
